it is the 26th March and its about 30 minutes after the release of BATTLE NO.1
They have 13 collaborators on that currently
counting Oranger,Ky and DPS right now who arent finished I have 13 aswell. 
I need to find another innocent victim to partake and increase my score by 1 so 
that I can be very very funny and top them within a week of them releasing
That thought  is REALLY funny and I want to do it
so I can get my imaginary crown of most collaborators back :^)
