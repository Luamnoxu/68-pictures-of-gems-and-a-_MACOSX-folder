thanks to star for giving me this idea (you will be forever cursed)
thanks to oranger for being able to live through my chaos
thank you to baal for being the cat I pet while in my evil armchair
thank you to taro for yin bao, I am becoming yin bao while working on this project, like seriously I am starting to feel like an evil scheming villain stealing files
thank you to aura for whatever exactly the walter white image is, and for listening to my chaos. If it wasnt for you this would still be 8 minutes (8 minutes here is a bad thing because as of writing its 2/22/2022 and I have just more than a month to finish this file for april fools and so far only about half of it is in a shippable state)

I NEED to have more than 8 people in this
